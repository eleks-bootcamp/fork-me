# Expectations
My expectations are:
  - To improve my knowleges in git and github, as they are grounded, as we are using other source control software on the project (not git)
  - To improve my knowleges in web development (as I'm desktop developer), partucularly in frontend as they rely only on analyzing souce code of some other sites. I'd like to find out more about professional aproaches in web development, espesially web sites with dynamic changable content (like webstores etc).
