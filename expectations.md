# Expectations
Attending this course, I expect to attain some basic skills in front-end development. 
A couple of years ago I started studying different materials in this field, but then I gave it up because of having no reason to carry on. 
I don't know exactly why I'm so motivated now and I have such desire to become a qualified specialist. 
Anyway, now I'm willing this and I'm sure this course will be my first step in my new career. 
Thank anybody helps me!
